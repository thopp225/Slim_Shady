						<p>The Hydrogen and Methane Breath Test is simple and non-invasive.  Test results are used by clinicians in conjunction with their clinical impressions and a patient evaluation to assist in the determination of lactose Intolerance, fructose malabsorption, sucrose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Studies have demonstrated the importance of hydrogen and methane gas production, indicating more than 30% of healthy adult subjects produce methane gas in addition to or instead of hydrogen gas. The addition of methane gas detection provides medical professionals the most comprehensive data to better determine the cause of gastrointestinal disorders and symptoms. Patient breath samples are collected following a 24 hour preparation period.  Patients follow a limited diet during the first 12 hours, then fast for the last 12 hours prior to their breath sample collections.  Patient breath samples are sent back to Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> for analysis.</p>

					<h2 class="ser-title">What do breath tests have to do with digestive problems?</h2>
					<hr class="botm-line">
						<p>When some bacteria digest (or ferment) food substances, they produce acids, water, and gases. The major gases which are produced by bacteria include, primarily, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and small concentrations of aromatic gases. Carbon dioxide is produced by all cells during metabolism, but only bacteria can produce H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> as metabolic by-products, and this is accomplished primarily by bacteria which thrive in the absence of oxygen (called anaerobic bacteria). So, if either H<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> are produced biologically, it tells us that some food substance is exposed to bacterial fermentation.</p> 
						<p>In the digestive tract, bacteria are normally limited to the colon. Most of the bacteria contained in food are killed by the acidity of the stomach, so the small intestine usually has few bacteria. In some conditions, called "bacteria overgrowth," bacteria exist in high concentrations in the small intestine. Their presence in that area can interfere with the absorption of some vitamins and other essential foodstuffs, so it is important to diagnose the condition.
						<p>The colon is concerned with conserving water and salt by reabsorbing them from the lumenal contents. However, the colon is involved in other functions, some of which depend on having a high bacterial count. Fiber, very popular in breakfast cereals, is not digested in the small intestine, so it undergoes bacterial fermentation in the colon. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by that process are absorbed in the colon, and are beneficial to health. It is becoming apparent that substantial amounts of starch (10-20% of foods like legumes) escape digestion in the small intestine and are broken down in the colon, thus, adding to the efficiency of energy production by such foodstuffs. In addition, colonic bacteria contribute to fecal bulk, and the short-chain fatty acids mentioned above reduce colonic pH. These factors may reduce the likelihood of diarrhea, confer some degree of protection against other severe colon problems, and enhance the colonic absorption of metal ions like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Thus, fermentation in the colon is normal, and is important.
						<p>Gases which are produced in the colon are reabsorbed and equilibrated with the blood leaving that area. They appear in the lung and cross the capillary membrane into the alveoli, from which they expired during breathing. The alveolar air can be collected with the analytical equipment utilized by Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> and analyzed.
						<p>Hydrogen and methane are produced in the digestive system primarily only by the bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugars, starches or vegetable fibers), so either of the gases appear in the expired air, it is usually a signal that carbohydrates or carbohydrate fragments have been exposed to bacteria, permitting such fermentation to take place<sup class=aero-sup>(2)</sup>. The generation of H<sub>2</sub> and/or CH<sub>4</sub> will result in the reabsorption of some of these gases into the blood stream from the site of their digestion, and they will appear in the expired air.
						<p>Bacteria are ordinarily not present in significant numbers in the small intestine, where digestion and absorption of sugars take place. Therefore, when a challenge dose (eg. lactose) is ingested, the level of hydrogen in the alveolar air will rise significantly within one to two hours (depending on the intestinal transit time) only if the sugar is not digested and, therefore reaches the colon.
						<p>The hydrogen breath test is a simple non-invasive procedure which is readily accepted by patients and staff <sup class=aero-sup>(3),</sup>, and which has greater reliability and acceptability than the blood test, according to many reports <sup class=aero-sup>(1, 4-8)</sup>. The lower dose of lactose usually does not cause the discomfort and explosive diarrhea frequently seen by malabsorbers who are given the larger dose required for the blood test <sup class=aero-sup>(9)</sup>.
						<p>A study <sup class=aero-sup>(10)</sup> with over 300 patients showed that gastrointestinal symptoms after a lactose challenge are strongly associated with the amount of H<sub>2</sub> excreted; the relationship between blood glucose change and symptom-severity was less evident.
						<p>False positive breath-tests are rare, and when they occur they are usually caused by improperly doing the test - allowing the subject to smoke, sleep or eat shortly before or during the test <sup class=aero-sup>(11)</sup>. Bacterial overgrowth (from the colon retrograde into the small intestine) can also produce a false-positive breath-test, but it is usually preceded by an elevated fasting breath-H<sub>2</sub> level and the response is seen soon after the sugar is ingested (within 20-30 minutes).
						<p>The incidence of false-negative results with the breath-test is well below that seen with the blood test <sup class=aero-sup>(1,4,5)</sup>. False-negative results are reported to be from 5-15% of all lactose malabsorbers, <sup class=aero-sup>(12-14)</sup> due to a variety of causes. Many of the false-negative reports can be avoided by measuring methane in addition to hydrogen <sup class=aero-sup>(15)</sup> because some methanogenic flora convert colonic H<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>.

					<h2 class="ser-title">History of Breath Testing</h2>
					<hr class="botm-line">
						<p>Breath trace-gases were first used as an indicator that complex sugars (disaccharides) were not broken down (hydrolyzed) and absorbed in the small intestine during the digestion of foods. Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) was measured in the breath after administering a dose of sugar to be studied. The widest application of the test was for lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance, which is related to milk intolerance in a majority of adults world-wide. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the NIH (USA) estimates that between 30 and 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant. The hydrogen breath-test (HBT) replaced a blood-test that was based on the absence of blood glucose response following lactose ingestion. The test is not as reliable as the HBT test since it produces a greater proportion of false negative and false positive tests.</p>
						<p>The incidence of lactose malabsorption throughout the world is surprising to most people. Adults who cannot digest milk sugar make up the majority of the worlds population. Those who can drink milk without getting sick are likely to be North Americans, Australians, or Northern Europeans. The ability to digest milk beyond the age of 3-5 years is genetically determined, and is a dominant trait.
						<p>When the reliability and simplicity of the hydrogen breath test was demonstrated with lactose, it was soon applied to other complex sugars like fructose (from fruits), maltose (from some starches), and sucrose (common table sugar, which is rarely absorbed). It has also been used in dietetic candy, sugar-free chewing gum, and other dietetic foods.
						<p>Recent studies have shown that methane has been added as a useful trace-gas for the study of digestive problems. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is an important intestinal gas and it should also be measured in studies of carbohydrate malabsorption in order to provide the most information to the clinician. Clinicians who are leaders in their medical community are beginning to work with methane and will continue to be well ahead of the field as CH<sub>4</sub> becomes more widely understood. Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> utilizes state-of-the-art analytical equipment and proprietary analysis of trace-gases that encompass H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>.
