							<h4>Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) Test</h4>
							<p>Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria enter your normally sterile small intestine and begin to colonize. This SIBO breath collection kit comes with either Glucose or Lactulose as a substrate. If you are requesting the test containing Lactulose, you must have your licensed clinician contact us directly to order. SIBO is a disorder of excessive bacterial growth in the small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria.  Patients with bacterial overgrowth typically develop symptoms including nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss and malabsorption.</p>

							<h4>Lactose Intolerance Test</h4>
							<p>Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose.  Lactose is the sugar found in dairy products such as milk and other dairy foods.  Intolerance to lactose typically lead to symptoms such as gas, bloating, diarrhea or cramping when dairy products are digested. These symptoms are a result of the body's lack of lactase, an enzyme normally produced by the small intestine that is needed to digest lactose.</p>

							<h4>Fructose Malabsorption Test</h4>
							<p class="space60">Fructose malabsorption is a digestive disorder when absorption of fructose is impaired. This results in an increased concentration of fructose in the intestine.  Occurrence is often seen in patients identified to be suffering symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, due to the similarity in symptoms, patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with irritable bowel syndrome. A small proportion of patients with both fructose malabsorption and lactose intolerance also suffer from celiac disease.</p>

							<h4>Sucrose Intolerance Test</h4>
							<p>Sucrose (common table sugar) is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. It is found in sugar cane, sugar beets and many fruits & vegetables. The enzyme sucrase (also called sucrase-isomaltase, saccharase or invertase) is present in both animal and plant tissues, and hydrolyzes sucrose into its two component monosaccharides.</p>

						<p>Gary,  on Tuesday of this week I referred a patient to Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> who previously tested positive twice for SIBO then was attempting to have a breath test at another facility but had a very difficult time receiving information from the staff. After speaking at length with her, she ultimately wanted to test at home so I provided the phone number for Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> and advised her I was placing her in the best hands possible and that she would be treated exceptionally well (all true).</p>
						<p>The patient called me this afternoon to thank me for referring her to Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> and stated that she had an amazing, outstanding, positive experience working with your group. I am not certain whom she spoke with but she stated all her questions were answered in a professional, educated, and very friendly manner and she very much appreciated the way she was treated. She also stated it was very refreshing to be treated so well by Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> as she often felt 'lost or like another number instead of a person' when working with most medical groups. She felt like the individual she spoke with genuinely cared and was eager to assist and did not rush her during the call. As she has other friends with similar health issues, she is happily referring them to Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> for assistance and is also advising her physician of her experience with Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> and the services you offer.</p>
						<p>I wanted to share this praise with you as too many times an organization that offers such outstanding service never truly knows the impact they have on their clients, you and your staff are making a very positive difference in the lives of many.</p>
						<p>Thank you for all that you and your staff do, very best regards to all!</p>

						<p>Hi Gary.  Thanks so much for your help the other day. I have to say compared to any other lab we work with, the support you offer is second to none. We actually did a SIBO event last week where there were patient examples of people recovering from SIBO and getting great results. I stood up and presented about Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> being the most accurate SIBO test available.</p>

	              <p>Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> was founded in June 2014 to serve patients' unmet needs. Patients confronted with gastrointestinal symptoms often suffer in silence for many years without resolution.</p>
				  <div class="h-divider">
				  <p>Patients who seek medical advice are routinely required to travel to clinics or hospitals typically located in urban areas. The Hydrogen ONLY (versus Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> Hydrogen & Methane) tests performed by many of these clinics and hospitals require the patent to schedule an appointment during the week and at a time that is convenient for the clinic or hospital staff. Additionally, these sites relegate the patient to more than three hours of testing with little to do in-between specimen collections.</p>
				  </div>
				  <p>These sites do not offer wifi or a quiet place to work or study during the test. Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> offers several convenient testing options. Our patients can take our tests in the convenience of their own home or place of employment, as well as at our comfortable site in Lexington Massachusetts. Aerodiagnostics<sup class=aero-sup>TM</sup> friendly & experienced staff offer patient assistance from 9:00am ET - 6:00pm ET, Monday through Friday and after hours assistance via scheduled appointments.</p>
